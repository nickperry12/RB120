# Why Object Oriented Programming?

Object Oriented Programming (**OOP**) is a programming paradigm that was created to deal with the growing complexity of large software systems. 
	- As applications grow in complexity and size, they become increasingly difficult to maintain
	- More code, more potential problems
	- One small change somewhere in the program can trigger a ripple effect of errors
		- This is due to dependencies on that piece of code in the entire program

A way was needed to create containers for data that could be manipulated without affecting the entire program.
	- Needed a way to section off areas of code that performed certain procedures
		- This allows programs to become the **interaction of many small parts**, as opposed to a giant blob of dependencies
		- Possibly helps narrow down where bugs could be

**Terminology**

**Encapsulation**
- This is hiding the pieces of functionality and making it unavailable to the rest of the code base
- It is a form of data protection, so that data cannot be manipulated without obvious intention
- Defines the boundaries in your application and allows code to achieve new levels of complexity
- Ruby (like many other OO languages), accomplishes this by creating objects and exposing interfaces (i.e., methods) to interact with those objects
	- This also allows the programmer to think on a new level of abstraction (the quality of dealing with ideas rather than events)
- Objects are represented as real-world nouns and can be given methods that describe the behavior the programmer is trying to represent

**Polymorphism**
- The ability for different types of data to respond to a common interface.
- For example, if we have a method that invokes the `move` method on it's argument, we can pass the method any type of argument as long as the argument has a compatible `move` method.
	- The object might represent a human, a cat, a jellyfish or even a car or train.
	- It lets objects of different types respond to the same method invocation
- OOP give us flexibility in using pre-written code for new purposes

The concept of **inheritance** is used in Ruby where a class inherits the behaviors of another class, referred to as the **superclass**. 
	- This gives Ruby programmers the power to define basic classes with large reusability and smaller **subclasses** for more fine-grained, detailed behaviors.

Another way to apply polymorphic structure to Ruby programs is to use a `Module`. Modules are similar to classes in that they contain shared behavior; but you cannot create an object with a module.
	- A module must be mixed in with a class using the `include` method invocation. 
	- This is called a **mixin**.
		- After mixing in a module, the behaviors declared in that module are available to the class and its objects. 

# What are objects?

You will often hear the phrase "In Ruby, everything is an object!" in the Ruby community.
	- It is more complex with this and is necessary to get a handle on basic Ruby syntax before thinking about objects
		- Side note: It's not even strictly true; not everything in Ruby is an object. However, anything that can be said to have a value **is** an object: that includes numbers, strings, arrays and even classes and modules. 
		- Three things that stand out that are not objects are methods, blocks and variables.

Objects are created from classes. 
	- Think of classes as molds and objects as things you produce out of those molds.
	- Individual objects will contain different information from other objects, yet they are instances of the same class

Here's an example of two objects of the `String` class:

```ruby
"hello".class
=> String

"world".class
=> String
```

We use the `class` instance method to determine what the class is for each object.
	- As you can see everything we've been using, from strings to integers, are in fact objects, which are instantiated from a class.
		- Will dig deeper into this soon

**Classes Define Objects**

Attributes and behaviors of its objects are defined in **classes**
	- Think of classes as basic outlines of what an object should be made of and what it should be able to do

To define a class, we use syntax similar to defining a method.
	- We replace `def` with `class` and use the CamelCase naming convetion to create the name.
	- We use the reserved word `end` to finish the definition.
	- Ruby file names should be in snake_case and reflect the class name. 
	- In the below example, the file name is `good_dog.rb` and the classname is `GoodDog`

```ruby
# good_dog.rb

class GoodDog
end

sparky = GoodDog.new
```

In this example, we create an instance of our `GoodDog` class and stored it in the variable `sparky`.
	- We now have an object

We say that `sparky` is an object or instance of class `GoodDog` .
	- This entire workflow of creating a new object or instance from a class is called **instantiation**, so we can also say that we've instantiated an object called `sparky` from the class `GoodDog` (**IMPORTANT** => REMEMBER THIS TERMINOLOGY)
		- The important fact here is that an object is returned by calling the class method `new`.

Take a look at the below figure to visualize what's happening:

![[Pasted image 20230330140803.png]]


`sparky` is instantiated from the `GoodDog` class. The instance variable `@name` is initialized to the `string` `"Sparky`" and the instance variable `@age` is initialized to `4`. 

**Modules**

Modules are another way to achieve polymorphism in Ruby.

A **module** is a collection of behaviors that is useable in other classes via **mixins**. A module is "mixed in" to a class using the `include` method invocation.
	- Let's say we wanted our `GoodDog` class to have a `speak` method but we have other classes that we want to use a speak method as well.

```ruby
good_dog.rb

module Speak
	def speak(sound)
		puts sound
	end
end

class GoodDog
	include Speak
end

class HumanBeing
	include Speak
end

sparky = GoodDog.new
sparky.speak("Arf!")  # => Arf!
bob = HumanBeing.new
bob.speak("Hello!")  # => Hello!
```

Note that in this example, both the `GoodDog` object, which we're calling `sparky`, as well as the `HumanBeing` object, which we're calling `bob`, have access to the `speak` instance method.
	- This is possible by "mixing in" the module `Speak`. 
		- Think of it as if we've copy-pasted the `speak` method into the `GoodDog` and `HumanBeing` classes

**Method Lookup**

When you call a method, how does Ruby know where to look for that method?
	- Ruby has a distinct lookup path that it follows each time a method is called.
	- Using the program from above, let's see what the method lookup path is for our `GoodDog` class.
		- We can use the `ancestors` method on any class to find out the method lookup chain.
		- The output should look like this:

```
---GoodDog ancestors---
GoodDog
Speak
Object
Kernel
BasicObject

---HumanBeing ancestors---
HumanBeing
Speak
Object
Kernel
BasicObject
```

The `Speak` module is placed between custom classes (in this case `GoodDog` and `HumanBeing` ) and the `Object` class that comes with Ruby. 
	- We wil see in `Inheritance` how the method lookup chain works when working with both mixins and class inheritance

This means that since the `speak` method is not defined in the `GoodDog` class, the next place it looks is the `Speak` module. 
	- This continues in an ordered, linear fashion, until the method is either found, or there are no more places to look.

# Summary

This was a quick overview of OOP in Ruby. The next couple of chapters we'll delve into the details.

# Exercises

1. How do we create an object in Ruby? Give an example of the creation of an object.

```ruby
# My Solution
class Computer
end

gaming_pc = Computer.new

# LS Solution

class MyClass
end

my_obj = MyClass.new
```

2. What is a module? What is its purpose? How do we use them with our classes? Create a module for the class you created in exercise 1 and include it properly.

- Modules are a collection of behaviors that are usable in other classes via **mixins**; and are mixed into a class using the `include` method. They are another way to achieve polymorphism.

```ruby
# My Solution
module Output
	def intro_message(message)
		puts "Welcome! This is your computer speaking!"
	end
end

class Computer
	include Output
end

class GamingComputer
	include Output
end

nicks_pc = GamingComputer.new
nicks_home_pc = Computer.new

# LS Solution
module Study
end

class MyClass
  include Study
end

my_obj = MyClass.new
```
