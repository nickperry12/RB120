What is inheritance?
- It is when a class **inherits** a behavior from another class.
	- The class that is inheriting behavior is called the subclass and the class it inherits it from is called the superclass

What is inheritance used for?
- It is used as a way to extract common behaviors from classes that share that behavior, and move it to a superclass
	- Allows us to keep logic in one place

## Class Inheritance

Let's look at an example of inheritance using the `GoodDog` class. We're going to extract the `speak` method from `GoodDog` to the superclass `Animal` .
- We'll then use inheritance to make that behavior to available to `GoodDog` and `Cat` classes.

```ruby
# good_dog_class.rb

class Animal
	def speak
		"Hello!"
	end
end

class GoodDog < Animal
end

class Cat < Animal
end

sparky = GoodDog.new
paws = Cat.new
puts sparky.speak       # => "Hello!"
puts paws.speak         # => "Hello!"
```

Notice we use the `<` symbol to signify the `GoodDog` and `Cat` classes are inheriting from the `Animal` class.
- This means that the methods within the `Animal` class will be made available to both the `GoodDog` and `Cat` classes.
	- Both classes are now using the superclass `Animal ` 's `speak` method.

What if we wanted to use the original `speak` method from the `GoodDog` class?

```ruby
# good_dog_class.rb

class Animal
	def speak
		"Hello!"
	end
end

class GoodDog < Animal
	attr_accessor :name

	def initialize(n)
		self.name = n
	end

	def speak
		"#{self.name} says arf!"
	end
end

class Cat < Animal
end

sparky = GoodDog.new("Sparky")
paws = Cat.new

puts sparky.speak        # => "Sparky says arf!"
puts paws.speak          # => "Hello!"
```

By adding in a `speak` method within the `GoodDog` class, that method is now **overriding** the `speak` method in the `Animal` superclass. 
- Why does this happen?
	- Ruby checks the object's class for the method first before looking in the superclass

Inheritance can be a great way to remove duplication in your code base.
- "DRY" => Don't Repeat Yourself
	- If you find yourself writing the same logic over and over again in your programs, there are ways to extract that logic to one place for use.

## super

In Ruby we have the keyword `super` that we can use to call methods earlier in the lookup path.
- When `super` is called from within a method, it searches the method lookup path for a method with the same name, and then invokes it.

Example:

```ruby
class Animal
	def speak
		"Hello!"
	end
end

class GoodDog < Animal
	def speak
		super + " from GoodDog class"
	end
end

sparky = GoodDog.new
sparky.speak     # => "Hello! from GoodDog class"
```

Notice how you get the output from both instance methods.
- An output from the `GoodDog` class instance method `speak` and the other from the `Animal` superclass instance method `speak`.
- The `GoodDog` class which subclasses `Animal` which also has a `speak` instance method. The `speak` method within `GoodDog` should override the `speak` method within animal due to the method lookup path
	- However, we use the keyword `super` to invoke the `speak` method within the `Animal` superclass
		- The functionality is then extended by appending text to the return value

Another common way of using `super` is with the `initialize` method.

Example:

```ruby
class Animal
	attr_accessor :name

	def initialize(name)
		@name = name
	end
end

class GoodDog < Animal
	def initialize(color)
		super
		@color = color
	end
end

bruno = GoodDog.new("brown")    # => # => #<GoodDog:0x007fb40b1e6718 @color="brown", @name="brown">
```

Here, we're using `super` with no arguments.
- However the `initialize` method within `GoodDog` (where `super` is being used), takes an argument and adds a twist to how `super` is invoked
	- In addition to the default behavior of calling methods earlier in the lookup path, `super` automatically forwards the arguments that are passed into the method from which `super` is called (this `initialize` method in `GoodDog`)
		- `super` is passing the `color` argument from the subclass to the superclass `Animal` and invoke it
		- This is why we have the presence of `@name = "brown"` when the `bruno` object is instantiated
		- The subclass' `initialize` method continues to set the `@color` instance variable

We can also call `super` with specific arguments, eg. `super(a, b) `, where the specified arguments will be sent up the method lookup chain.

Example:

```ruby
class BadDog < Animal
	def initialize(age, name)
		super(name)
		@age = age
	end
end

BadDog.new(2, "bear")    # => #<BadDog:0x007fb40b2beb68 @age=2, @name="bear">
```

The passed in argument `name` is being sent to the superclass.
- When a `BadDog` class is created, the passed in argument ("bear") is passed to the superclass and set to the `@name` instance variable. 

If we call `super()` exactly as shown here, it calls the method in the superclass with no arguments.
- If you have a method in your superclass that takes no arguments, this is the safest (and sometimes the only way) to call it

```ruby
class Animal
  def initialize
  end
end

class Bear < Animal
  def initialize(color)
    super()
    @color = color
  end
end

bear = Bear.new("black")        # => #<Bear:0x007fb40b1e6718 @color="black">
```

Without the parentheses, an `ArgumentError` is thrown since the number of arguments is incorrect.

## Mixing in Modules

We can also use **modules** to avoid repeating ourself in our code.

Extracting common methods to a superclass is a great way to model concepts that are naturally hierarchical. Our example used animals.
- We have the superclass `Animal` that can contain all the basic behaviors of all animals.
	- This can be expanded upon, and we can have a subclass of `Mammal` .
	- The entire class hierarchy can look something like this:

![[Pasted image 20230404161852.png]]

This diagram shows what pure class based inheritance looks like. 
- What is the goal of this?
	- The goal is to put the right behavior (i.e., methods) in the right class so code doesn't need to be repeated in multiple classes.

We can imagine that all `Fish` objects are related to animals that live in the water, so perhaps a `swim` method should be in the `Fish` class.

We can also imagine that all `Mammal` objects will have warm blood, so we can have a `warm_blooded?` instance method within the `Mammal` class that returns `true `.
- The objects `Cat` and `Dog` will also have access to the `warm_blooded? ` method.
	- This method will be automatically inherited from `Mammal` by the `Cat ` and `Dog ` classes.
		- However, these classes will not have access to the methods within the `Fish` class.

While this type of hierarchical modelling works, there are always exceptions. We know that there are mammals that are capable of swimming. But, we don't want to move the `swim` method into `Animal` because not animals are capable of doing so.
- But what if we placed the `swim` method within the subclasses of `Animal ` that are capable?
	- This violates the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle

For concerns like these, we can group them into a module and then *mix in* that module to the classes that require those behaviors.

Example:

```ruby
module Swimmable
	def swim
		"I'm swimming!"
	end
end

class Animal; end

class Fish < Animal
	include Swimmable       # mixing in Swimmable module
end

class Mammal < Animal
end

class Cat < Mammal

class Dog < Mammal
	include Swimmable       # mixing in Swimmable module
end
```

The `Fish` and `Dog` objects now have the capability of using the `swim ` method, but objects of other classes won't be able to.

```ruby
sparky = Dog.new
neemo  = Fish.new
paws   = Cat.new

sparky.swim                 # => I'm swimming!
neemo.swim                  # => I'm swimming!
paws.swim                   # => NoMethodError: undefined method `swim' for #<Cat:0x007fc453152308>
```

Using modules to group common behaviors allows us to build a more powerful, flexible and DRY design.

_Note: A common naming convention for Ruby is to use the "able" suffix on whatever verb describes the behavior that the module is modeling. You can see this convention with our `Swimmable` module. Likewise, we could name a module that describes "walking" as `Walkable`. Not all modules are named in this manner, however, it is quite common.

## Inheritance vs Modules

Forming a mental model:

Class inheritance
- One type inherits the behaviors of another type
	- The result is a new type that specializes the type of the superclass
- The other form of inheritance is sometimes called **interface inheritance**
	- This is where mixin modules come into play
	- The class inherits the interface provided by the mixin module
		- In this case, the result type is not a specialized type with respect to the module

When do we use class inheritance vs class mixins?
- There are things we must consider before deciding:

1. You can only subclass (class inheritance) from one class. You can mix in as many modules (interface inheritance) as you'd like
2. If there's an "is-a" relationship, class inheritance is usually the correct choice. If there's a "has-a" relationship, interface inheritance is generally a better choice. For example, a dog "is an" animal and it "has an" ability to swim.
3. You cannot instantiate modules. Objects cannot be created from modules.

## Method Lookup Path

Let's put both inheritance and mixins together and see how this affects our *method lookup path*. 
- Remember, the method lookup path is the order in which classes are inspected when you call a method.

Example:

```ruby
module Walkable
	def walk
		"I'm walking."
	end
end

module Swimmable
	def swim
		"I'm swimming."
	end
end

module Climbable
	def climb
		"I'm climbing."
	end
end

class Animal
	include Walkable

	def speak
		"I'm an animal, and I speak!"
	end
end
```

So what do we have in this code snippet?
- We have 3 modules: `Walkable `, `Climbable `, and `Swimmable `, and one class: `Animal ` 
	- The `Animal ` class has a module mixed into it: `Walkable ` 

To see the method look up path, we can use the `ancestors` method.

Our output looks like this:

```
Animal
Walkable
Object
Kernel
BasicObject
```

What does this mean?
- When we call a method of any `Animal ` object, Ruby will first look in the `Animal ` class, and then the `Walkable ` module, then the `Object ` class, then the `Kernel ` module, and finally the `BasicObject ` class.

Let's instantiate an object and invoke the `speak ` method on it:

```ruby
fido = Animal.new
fido.speak      # => "I'm an animal, and I speak!"
```

When Ruby goes to lookup the `speak ` instance method, it will first look in the `Animal ` class.
- It finds the method here and will look no further.

```ruby
fido.walk      # => "I'm walking."
```

A similar thing happens here. Ruby firsts checks the `Animal ` class for the `walk ` instance method. After not finding it, it will move onto the `Walkable ` module, where it will find the method, and will look no further.

```ruby
fido.swim
```

Ruby will check all classes and modules on the list, and will not find a `swim ` method that is available for the object (remember, the `Swimmable` module was not mixed in to the `Animal ` class), and an error is thrown.

Let's tweak the code and add another class.
- This class will inherit from the `Animal ` class and mix in the `Swimmable ` and `Climbable ` modules.

```ruby
# previous code ommited for brevity

class GoodDog < Animal
	include Swimmable
	include Climbable
end

puts GoodDog.ancestors
```

This will output:

```
GoodDog
Climbable
Swimmable
Animal
Walkable
Object
Kernel
BasicObject
```

There are several things we need to make note of with this:

1. This tells us that the order in which we include modules is important. Ruby looks at the last module we included *first*. In the rare occurrence that the mixed in modules contain a method with the same name, the last module included will be checked first.
2. The module included in the superclass made it on the method lookup path. That means that all `GoodDog ` objects will have access to not only `Animal ` methods, but also methods defined in the `Walkable ` module, as well as all other modules mixed in to any of its superclasses.

Why is understanding the method lookup path important?
- It gives us a better idea of where and how all available methods are organized.

## More Modules

We've seen how modules can be used to mix-in common behaviors into classes. But there are a couple more uses for modules.

###### Namespacing

Namespacing means organizing similar classes under a module.
- In other words, we'll use modules to group related classes

Therein lies the first advantage of using modules for namespacing. 
- It becomes easy for us to recognize related classes in our code
- The second advantage is that it reduces the likelihood of our classes colliding with other similarly named classes in our codebase

Example:

```ruby
module Mammal
	class Dog
		def speak(sound)
			p "#{sound}"
		end
	end

	class Cat
		def say_name(name)
			p "#{name}"
		end
	end
end
```

We can call classes in a module by appending the class name to the module name with two colons (` ::` )

```ruby
buddy = Mammal::Dog.new
kitty = Mammal::Dog.new
buddy.speak('Arf')          # => "Arf!"
kitty.say_name('kitty')     # => "kitty"
```

This will have the following output:

```
"Arf!"
"kitty"
```

###### Modules as Containers

Modules can also be used as a **container** for methods, called module methods.
- This involves using modules to house other methods

Why is this useful?
- Useful methods that seem out of place within your code

Example using the `Mammal ` module:

```ruby
module Mammal
  ...

  def self.some_out_of_place_method(num)
    num ** 2
  end
end
```

Defining methods this way within a module means we can call them directly from the module:

```ruby
value = Mammal.some_out_of_place_method(4)
```

We can also call such methods by doing:

```ruby
value = Mammal::some_out_of_place_method(4)
```

The former however, is preferred.

## Private, Protected and Public

Method Access Control...What is it?
- A concept that exists in multiple programming languages.
- Is generally implemented through the use of *access modifiers*.
- What's the purpose?
	- Allows or restricts access to a particular thing.
		- We're concerned with restricting access to methods defined in a class

How is it implemented?
- It is implemented through the use of the `public ` , `private ` and `protected ` access modifiers. 
- Currently, all the methods within our `GoodDog ` class are public methods.
	- A **public method** is available to anyone who knows either the class name or the object's name.
	- These methods are readily available for the rest of the program to use and comprise the class' *interface* (that's how other classes and objects will interact with this class and it's objects)

What if we had methods that did work in the class but don't need to be available to the rest of the program?
- Enter **private methods**
- These methods are defined by using the `private ` method call in our program
	- Anything below it is private (unless another method, like `protected `, is called after it to negate it)

In our `GoodDog ` class, we have one operation that takes place that we could move into a private method.
- When an object is instantiated of the `GoodDog ` class, the age is calculated in dog years. We can refactor this logic into a method and make it private so nothing outside of the class can use it:

```ruby
class GoodDog
  DOG_YEARS = 7

  attr_accessor :name, :age

  def initialize(n, a)
    self.name = n
    self.age = a
  end

  private

  def human_years
    age * DOG_YEARS
  end
end

sparky = GoodDog.new("Sparky", 4)
sparky.human_years
```

When we try to run this, we get the following error message:

```
NoMethodError: private method `human_years' called for
  #<GoodDog:0x007f8f431441f8 @name="Sparky", @age=4>
```

Why do we get this error?
- Because the `human_years ` method has been made private by placing it under the `private ` method.
- So what is the method good for if we cannot call it?
	- `private ` methods are only accessible from other methods in the class
	- For example, given the above code, the following code would be allowed:

```ruby
# assume the method definition below is above the "private" method call

def public_disclosure
	"#{self.name} in human years is #{human_years}"
end
```

Note that in this case, we cannot use `self.human_years `, because the `human_years ` method is private.
- Remember that `self.human_years ` is the equivalent to `sparky.human_years ` , which is not allowed for private methods.
	- Therefore, we have to just use `human_years ` 

In summary, private methods are not accessible outside of the class definition at all, and are only accessible from inside the class when called without `self ` .

While public and private methods are most common, there are some situations we'll want to use an in-between approach.
- For this we can use the `protected ` method to create **protected** methods.
	- These are similar to private methods in that they cannot be invoked outside the class.
	- The main difference is that protected methods allow access between class instances and private methods do not.

Example:

```ruby
class Person
	def initialize(age)
		@age = age
	end

	def older?(other_person)
		age > other_person.age
	end

	protected

	attr_reader :age
end

malory = Person.new(64)
sterling = Person.new(42)

malory.older?(sterling)    # => true
sterling.older?(malory)    # => false

malory.age # => NoMethodError: protected method `age' called for #<Person: @age=64>
```

This code snippet shows that like private methods, protected methods cannot be invoked outside of the class.
- But, other instances of the class (or subclass) can also invoke the method.
	- This allows for controlled access, but wider access between objects of the same class type.

## Accidental Method Overriding

There's an important thing to remember:
- Every class you create inherently subclasses from [class Object](https://ruby-doc.org/2.7.7/Object.html). The `Object ` class is built into Ruby and comes with many critical methods

```ruby
class Parent
	def say_hi
		p "Hi from Parent."
	end
end

Parent.superclass      # => Object
```

What does this mean?
- All methods defined in the `Object ` class are available in **ALL** classes.

Recall that through inheritance, a subclass can override a superclass' method.

```ruby
class Child < Parent
	def say_hi
		p "Hi from Child."
	end
end

child = Child.new
child.say_hi    # => "Hi from Child."
```

If you accidentally override a method that was originally defined in the `Object ` class, it can have far-reaching effects on your code.
- For example, `send ` is an instance method that all classes inherit from `Object ` .
	- If you defined a new `send ` method in your class, all objects of your class will call your custom `send ` method instead of the method in the class `Object ` , which is probably the method they meant to call.

How does the `send `  method work?
- Serves as way to call a method by passing it a symbol or a string (which represents the method you want to call)
	- The next couple of arguments will represent the method's arguments, if any

Example:

```ruby
son = Child.new
son.send :say_hi        # => "Hi from Child."
```

Now what happens if we define a method within our `Child ` class called `send ` ?

```ruby
class Child
	def say_hi
		 p "Hi from Child."
	 end

	def send
		p "send fom Child..."
	end
end


lad = Child.new
lad.send :say_hi
```

We expect this to output `"Hi from Child."` , but instead an error gets thrown:

```
/home/nickperry12/launch_school/RB120/Lesson_1/accidental_override_example.rb:12:in `send': wrong number of arguments (given 1, expected 0) (ArgumentError)
  from /home/nickperry12/launch_school/RB120/Lesson_1/accidental_override_example.rb:22:in `<main>'
```

We're passing `send ` one argument even though our overriden `send ` method does not take any arguments.

Let's take a look at another example using the `instance_of? ` of the `Object ` 's class.
- This method returns `true ` if an object is an instance of a given class and `false ` otherwise.

```ruby
c = Child.new
c.instance_of? Child       # => true
c.instance_of? Parent      # => false
```

Now let's override `instance_of? ` within `Child ` :

```ruby
class Child
	# other methods omitted

	def instance_of?
		p "I am a fake instance"
	end
end

heir = Child.new
heir.instance_of? Child
```

Same as before, we have an error thrown when we run this code. 

```
ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 0)
from (pry):22:in `instance_of?'
```

However, there is an instance method that's easily overriden but without any major repercussions: the `to_s ` method which we previously covered. 
- You'll normally want to override this method when you want a different string representation of an object.

It's important to familiarize yourself with some of the common `Object ` methods and make sure to not accidentally override them.
- Again, doing so can have major repercussions in your code for your application.

## Summary

At this point you should be feeling pretty comfortable with the general syntax and structure of the Ruby language. All this complex knowledge about OOP is meant to help us build better designed applications.
- While there are definitely *wrong* ways to design an application, there is often no right choice when it comes to object oriented, only different tradeoffs.

Make sure to take time to go through the following exercises. OOP is a tough concept if this is your first time encountering it.

## Exercises

1. Create a superclass called `Vehicle ` for your `MyCar ` class to inherit from and move the behavior that isn't specific to `MyCar ` to the superclass. Create a constant in your `MyCar ` class that stores information about the vehicle that makes it different from other types of Vehicles.

	Then create a new class called `MyTruck ` that inherits from your superclass that also has a constant defined that separates it from the `MyCar ` class in some way.

```ruby
# my_car.rb

# My Solution

class Vehicle
  def self.gas_mileage(kms, litres)
    puts "You are currently getting #{kms/litres} kms per litre."
  end

  def speed_up(s)
    self.speed += s
    puts "You step on the gas! Your speed is now #{self.speed} km/h!"
  end
  
  def slow_down(s)
    self.speed -= s
    puts "You hit the brakes! Your speed is now #{self.speed} km/h!"
  end
  
  def shut_off
    self.engine_state = 'off'
    "The engine is now off!"
  end
  
  def turn_on
    self.engine_state = 'on'
    "The engine is now on!"
  end

  def spray_paint(color)
    self.color = color
    puts "Your vehicle color is now #{color}!"
  end

  def vehicle_info
    "You are driving a #{color} #{year} #{model}."
  end
end

class MyTruck < Vehicle
  VIN_NUMBER = 0012314
  attr_accessor :year, :color, :model, :speed, :engine_state
  attr_reader :year, :color, :model, :speed, :engine_state

  def initialize(y, c, m)
    self.year = y
    self.color = c
    self.model = m
    self.speed = 0
    self.engine_state = 'on'
  end
end

class MyCar < Vehicle
  VIN = 00001234
  attr_accessor :year, :model, :color, :speed, :engine_state

  def initialize(y, m, c)
    self.year = y
    self.color = c
    self.model = m
    self.speed = 0
    self.engine_state = 'on'
  end
end
```

LS Solution:

```ruby
class Vehicle
  def self.gas_mileage(gallons, miles)
    puts "#{miles / gallons} miles per gallon of gas"
  end
end

class MyCar < Vehicle
  NUMBER_OF_DOORS = 4
end

class MyTruck < Vehicle
  NUMBER_OF_DOORS = 2
end
```


2. Add a class variable to your superclass that can keep track of the number of objects created that inherit from the superclass. Create a method to print out the value of this class variable as well.

```ruby
class Vehicle
  @@number_of_vehicles = 0
  
  def initialize
    @@number_of_vehicles += 1
  end

  

  def self.number_of_vehicles
    puts "There are #{@@number_of_vehicles} vehicles."
  end

  def self.gas_mileage(kms, litres)
    puts "You are currently getting #{kms/litres} kms per litre."
  end

  def speed_up(s)
    self.speed += s
    puts "You step on the gas! Your speed is now #{self.speed} km/h!"
  end

  def slow_down(s)
    self.speed -= s
    puts "You hit the brakes! Your speed is now #{self.speed} km/h!"
  end

  def shut_off
    self.engine_state = 'off'
    "The engine is now off!"
  end

  def turn_on
    self.engine_state = 'on'
    "The engine is now on!"
  end

  def spray_paint(color)
    self.color = color
    puts "Your vehicle color is now #{color}!"
  end

  def vehicle_info
    "You are driving a #{color} #{year} #{model}."
  end
end

class MyTruck < Vehicle
  VIN_NUMBER = 0012314

  attr_accessor :year, :color, :model, :speed, :engine_state
  attr_reader :year, :color, :model, :speed, :engine_state

  def initialize(y, c, m)
    self.year = y
    self.color = c
    self.model = m
    self.speed = 0
    self.engine_state = 'on'
    @@number_of_vehicles += 1
  end
end

class MyCar < Vehicle
  VIN = 00001234

  attr_accessor :year, :model, :color, :speed, :engine_state
  attr_reader :year, :model, :color, :speed, :engine_state

  def initialize(y, m, c)
    self.year = y
    self.color = c
    self.model = m
    self.speed = 0
    self.engine_state = 'on'
    @@number_of_vehicles += 1
  end
end
```


LS Solution:

```ruby
class Vehicle
  @@number_of_vehicles = 0

  def self.number_of_vehicles
    puts "This program has created #{@@number_of_vehicles} vehicles"
  end

  def self.gas_mileage(gallons, miles)
    puts "#{miles / gallons} miles per gallon of gas"
  end

  def initialize
    @@number_of_vehicles += 1
  end
end

class MyCar < Vehicle
  NUMBER_OF_DOORS = 4
  #code omitted for brevity...
end

class MyTruck < Vehicle
  NUMBER_OF_DOORS = 2
end
```

3. Create a module that you mix in to ONE of your subclasses that describes behavior unique to that class.

```ruby
# my solution

module FourWheelDrive
  def enable_4WD
    puts "Four Wheel Drive is now on!"
  end
end
```

LS Solution:

```ruby
module Towable
  def can_tow?(pounds)
    pounds < 2000
  end
end

class Vehicle
  @@number_of_vehicles = 0

  def self.number_of_vehicles
    puts "This program has created #{@@number_of_vehicles} vehicles"
  end

  def self.gas_mileage(gallons, miles)
    puts "#{miles / gallons} miles per gallon of gas"
  end

  def initialize
    @@number_of_vehicles += 1
  end
end

class MyCar < Vehicle
  NUMBER_OF_DOORS = 4
  #code omitted for brevity...
end

class MyTruck < Vehicle
  include Towable

  NUMBER_OF_DOORS = 2
end
```

4. Print to the screen your method lookup for the classes you have created.

```
------ Method Path --------
MyCar
Vehicle
Object
Kernel
BasicObject
------ Method Path --------
MyTruck
FourWheelDrive
Vehicle
Object
Kernel
BasicObject
```

5. Move all methods from the `MyCar` class that also pertain to the `MyTruck ` class into the `Vehicle ` class. Make sure all your previous method calls are working when finished.

**REFER TO SOLUTION 1**

6. Write a method called `age ` that calls a private method to calculate the age of the vehicle. Make sure the private method is not available from outside of the class. You'll need to use Ruby's built-in [Time](https://ruby-doc.org/2.7.7/Time.html) class to help.

```ruby
# Within Vehicle class
# rest of the code omitted

  def age
    puts "Your vehicle is #{vehicle_age} years old."
  end

  private

  def vehicle_age
    Time.now.year - self.year.to_i
  end
```

LS Solution:

```ruby
class Vehicle
  # code omitted for brevity...
  def age
    "Your #{self.model} is #{years_old} years old."
  end

  private

  def years_old
    Time.now.year - self.year
  end
end

# code omitted for brevity...

puts lumina.age   #=> "Your chevy lumina is 17 years old"
```

7. Create a class `Student ` with attributes `name ` and `grade ` . Do NOT make the grade getter public, so `joe.grade ` will raise an error. Create a `better_grade_than? ` method, that you can call like so:

```ruby
puts "Well done!" if joe.better_grade_than?(bob)
```


My solution:

```ruby
class Student
  def initialize(n, g)
    @name  = n
    @grade = g
  end

  def better_grade_than?(other_student)
    puts "Well done!" if grade < other_student.grade
  end

  protected

  def grade
    @grade
  end
end

joe = Student.new('Joe', 'A')
bob = Student.new('Bob', 'C')
joe.better_grade_than?(bob)
```

LS Solution

```ruby
class Student
  def initialize(name, grade)
    @name = name
    @grade = grade
  end

  def better_grade_than?(other_student)
    grade > other_student.grade
  end

  protected

  def grade
    @grade
  end
end

joe = Student.new("Joe", 90)
bob = Student.new("Bob", 84)
puts "Well done!" if joe.better_grade_than?(bob)
```

8. Given the following code...

```ruby
bob = Person.new
bob.hi
```

And the corresponding error message...

```
NoMethodError: private method `hi' called for #<Person:0x007ff61dbb79f0>
from (irb):8
from /usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-rc2/bin/irb:16:in `<main>'
```

The issue is that we are trying to call the method `hi ` on the object `bob ` , but the method we are calling is a private method as indicated by the error message. We can fix this by making it a public method, which involves moving the `hi ` method definition above the `private ` method call in the object class definition.
