Major concepts to understand:
- relationship between a class and an object
- idea that a class groups behaviors (i.e., methods)

## Object level

- objects do not share state between other objects, but do share behaviors
- put another way, the values in objects' instance variables (states) are different, but they can call the same instance methods (behaviors) defined in the class

## Class Level

- sub-classing form parent class. Can only sub-class from 1 parent; used to model hierarchical relationships
- mixing in modules. Can mix in as many modules as needed; Ruby's way of implementing multiple inheritance
- understand how sub-classing or mixing in modules affects the method lookup path
