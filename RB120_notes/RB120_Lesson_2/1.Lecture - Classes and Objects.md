Classes are the blueprints for objects. Below are some practice problems that test your knowledge of the connection between classes and objects.

1. Given the below usage of the `Person ` class, code the class definition.

```ruby
bob = Person.new('bob')
bob.name                  # => 'bob'
bob.name = 'Robert'
bob.name                  # => 'Robert'
```

My Solution:

```ruby
class Person
  attr_accessor :name
  
  def initialize(n)
    self.name = n
  end
end
```

LS Solution: 

```ruby
class Person
  attr_accessor :name

  def initialize(n)
    @name = n
  end
end
```


2. Modify the class definition from above to facilitate the following methods. Note that there is no `name= ` setter method now.

```ruby
bob = Person.new('Robert')
bob.name                  # => 'Robert'
bob.first_name            # => 'Robert'
bob.last_name             # => ''
bob.last_name = 'Smith'
bob.name                  # => 'Robert Smith'
```

My Solution:

```ruby
class Person
  attr_accessor :first_name, :last_name

  def initialize(n)
    split_name = n.split
    @first_name = split_name[0]
    @last_name = split_name.size > 1 ? split_name[-1] : ''
  end

  def name
    "#{first_name} #{last_name}".strip
  end
end
```

LS Solution:

```ruby
class Person
  attr_accessor :first_name, :last_name

  def initialize(full_name)
    parts = full_name.split
    @first_name = parts.first
    @last_name = parts.size > 1 ? parts.last : ''
  end

  def name
    "#{first_name} #{last_name}".strip
  end
end
```

3. Now create a smart `name= ` method that can take just a first name or a full name, and knows how to set the `first_name` and `last_name` appropriately.

My Solution:

```ruby
class Person
  attr_accessor :first_name, :last_name

  def initialize(n)
    parse_full_name(n)
  end

  def name
    "#{first_name} #{last_name}".strip
  end

  def name=(n)
    parse_full_name(n)
  end

  private

  def parse_full_name(n)
    split_name = n.split
    @first_name = split_name[0]
    @last_name = split_name.size > 1 ? split_name[-1] : ''
  end
end
```

4. Using the class definition from step #3, let's create a few more people -- that is, `Person` objects.

```ruby
bob = Person.new('Robert Smith')
rob = Person.new('Robert Smith')
```

My Solution:

```ruby
p bob.name == rob.name
```

LS Solution:

```ruby
bob.name == rob.name
```

5. Continuing with our `Person` class definition, what does the below code print out?

```ruby
bob = Person.new("Robert Smith")
puts "The person's name is: #{bob}"
```

My Solution:

This will print out the following string:

"The person's name is: bob.Person: hex_code, instance vars, etc"

LS Solution:

The person's name is: #<Person:0x007fb873252640>

Notes on solution:

When using string interpolation, and interpolating the object name into the string, it will output the object and it's hex code. This is similar to calling the `object_id ` method on an object and getting its numerical code value. 

What's happening here is Ruby is calling the `to_s ` method on the object, which prints out the string representation of it's place in memory.

How could we make this output the name associated with the object?

We can create a `to_s ` method within the class definition to override the build in `to_s ` method.

```ruby
class Person
# rest of code omitted

	def to_s
		name
	end
end

bob = Person.new("Robert Smith")
puts "The person's name is: #{bob}" # => The person's name is: Robert Smith
```
