Class based inheritance works great when it's used to model hierarchical domains. Let's take a look at a few practice problems. Suppose we're building a software system for a pet hotel business, so our classes deal with pets.

1.  Given this class:

```ruby
class Dog
  def speak
    'bark!'
  end

  def swim
    'swimming!'
  end
end

teddy = Dog.new
puts teddy.speak           # => "bark!"
puts teddy.swim           # => "swimming!"
```

One problem is that we need to keep track of different breeds of dogs, since they have slightly different behaviors. For example, bulldogs can't swim, but all other dogs can.

Create a sub-class from `Dog` called `Bulldog` overriding the `swim` method to return "can't swim!".

My Solution:

```ruby
=begin
To achieve this we can create a subclass called `Bulldog` that inherits the
behaviors from the `Dog` superclass. 

We can then define an instance method specific to this subclass with the same
name as the `swim` method in the `Dog` superclass. This will override the method
in the superclass (recall that in the method lookup chain, Ruby will check the
class the calling object belongs to first). 
=end

class Dog
  def speak
    'bark!'
  end

  def swim
    'swimming!'
  end
end

class Bulldog < Dog
  def swim
    "I can't swim!"
  end
end

teddy = Dog.new
puts teddy.speak           # => "bark!"
puts teddy.swim           # => "swimming!"

angel = Bulldog.new
puts angel.speak
puts angel.swim
```

LS Solution:

```ruby
class Bulldog < Dog
  def swim
    "can't swim!"
  end
end

karl = Bulldog.new
puts karl.speak           # => "bark!"
puts karl.swim            # => "can't swim!"

=begin
Note that since `Bulldog` objects are instantiated from a sub-class of `Dog`, they can both override and inherit methods from the `Dog` class. That is why `karl` can speak
=end
```

2. Let's create a few more methods for our `Dog` class.

```ruby
class Dog
  def speak
    'bark!'
  end

  def swim
    'swimming!'
  end

  def run
    'running!'
  end

  def jump
    'jumping!'
  end

  def fetch
    'fetching!'
  end
end
```

Create a new class called `Cat`, which can do everything a dog can, except swim or fetch. Assume the methods do the exact same thing. Hint: don't just copy and paste all methods in `Dog` into `Cat`; try to come up with some class hierarchy.

My solution:

```ruby
=begin
We can extract the common behaviors from the `Dog` class and place them in a
superclass called `Animal`. We can then have our subclasses (`Dog`, `Cat`, etc) inherit those behaviors from the superclass. We can also add behaviors specific to the subclass into the subclass definition. Additionally, we can add a speak method into `Animal` that simply outputs `"(Animal name) says "`, and add a `speak` method into `Cat` and `Dog` that calls the `super` method and concatenates the sound the specific object makes.
=end

class Animal
  def initialize(n)
    @name = n
  end

  def speak
    "#{@name} says "
  end

  def run
    'running!'
  end

  def jump
    'jumping!'
  end
end

class Cat < Animal
  def speak
    super + 'meow!'
  end
end

class Dog < Animal
  def speak
    super + 'arf!'
  end

  def swim
    'swimming!'
  end

  def fetch
    'fetching!'
  end
end

pupper = Dog.new('Tommy')
kitty = Cat.new('Prinkles')

puts pupper.speak
puts kitty.speak
puts kitty.swim
puts pupper.swim
```

3. Draw a class hierarchy diagram of the classes from step #2

4. What is the *method lookup path* and how is it important?

The method lookup path is the path Ruby takes to find where the method that is being called. It's important because when defining methods in classes, if the defined method has the same name as another method further up the chain, it will override that method. For example, we have a `speak ` method in both the `Animal ` superclass and a `speak ` method in in the `Dog ` and `Cat ` subclasses. When we call `speak ` on an object of either of those subclasses, Ruby will first look within the object's class before looking further up the class hierarchy.
