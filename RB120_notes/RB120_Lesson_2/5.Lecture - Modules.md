There are limitations of class inheritance in Ruby
- A class can only directly sub-class from one super class
	- This is called **single inheritance**
		- Can make it very difficult to accurately model the problem domain
		- Suppose we have a pet animal called `Fish ` 
			- They can swim, and have other characteristics like living in a small bowl etc. 
			- They cannot jump or run, which are instance methods within the `Pet ` class.
			- Reorganizing of methods is required

This seems fine, however we have `swim ` in both the `Dog ` and `Fish ` class (the `swim ` in Bulldog is to override the one in `Dog ` , and therefore performs a different functionality).
- We'd like to not have the same `swim ` method in two different classes, but where else could we move it to?
	- Again, we can only sub-class from one parent class

Some programming languages allow classes to directly inherit from multiple classes -- commonly known as *multiple inheritance*. 
- Ruby's answer to this is by way of mixing in behaviors
	- A class can only sub-class from one parent, but it can mix in as many modules as it likes

The solution to our problem up above is to create a module called `Swimmable ` and mix it into the appropriate classes.

```ruby
module Swimmable
	def swim
		"swimming!"
	end
end

class Dog
	include Swimmable
	# rest of code omitted
end

class Fish
	include Swimmable
	# rest of code omitted
end
```

The result is that all instance methods defined in the `Swimmable ` module are now ready for use within the `Fish ` and `Dog ` classes.
- Can mix in as many modules as we need to
	- Keep in mind this does affect the method lookup path
