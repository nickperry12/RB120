Class Responsibility Collaborator (CRC) cards is a way to model the various classes of a program.
- Usually, we draw up some CRC cards as a part of the brainstorming session to come up with our classes, but for instructional purposes, we'll go over the classes from the RPS game.

Here are the components of a CRC card:

Here is an example of a CRC card for the `Human ` class:

And if we create a CRC card for all the classes in the RPS game, we would have a CRC model:

And then finally, we have our CRC card for the `RPSGame ` class:

Note that we didn't list all of the methods in the class. We only want to list *public* methods that can or should be called from the outside of the class.
- Methods like `display_welcome_message ` are used internally by the `play ` method, and are more of an implementation detail.

### Summary

CRC cards are another tool to help you organize your ideas. In general, you should follow the below approach:

1.  Write a description of the problem and extract major nouns and verbs.
2.  Make an initial guess at organizing the verbs and nouns into methods and classes/modules, then do a spike to explore the problem with temporary code.
3.  When you have a better idea of the problem, model your thoughts into CRC cards.

Don't be afraid to make mistakes; remember, there is likely no "right" design. Feel free to tweak this approach to fit your style.
