We've seen in previous assignments that some methods look like operators due to Ruby's **syntactical sugar**.
- Instead of calling the method like normal -- ` str1.==(str2) ` , we can instead call it with a special syntax that reads more naturally -- ` str1 == str2 ` 
- This is one reason why Ruby is hard for beginners (its liberal syntax)

What other operators are actually methods being invoked with special syntax?

The operators that are marked with a 'yes' in the method column are in fact methods.
- We can define them in our classes to change their default behaviors. 
	- Seems like a useful feature, but the other side is that since any class can provide their own fake operator methods, reading code like ` obj1 + obj2 ` means we have no idea what will happen.

The ` . ` and ` :: ` resolution operators (e.g., ` dog.bark ` and ` Math::PI ` ) are often omitted from Ruby documentation about operators. They are indeed operators, and have the highest precedence of all operators.

Let's look at how we can use the fake operators in a sensible way.

#### Equality Methods

One of the most commonly overriden fake operators is the ` == ` equality operator.
- Very useful to provide your own ` == ` method.
- Also gives us a ` != ` method automatically

You can also define a ` != ` method but we need to be careful about it. It wouldn't make sense if two objects could be both equal and not equal simultaneously, which is possible if you override both ` == ` and ` != ` .

```ruby
class Foo
	attr_reader :value

	def initialize(value)
		@value = value
	end

	def ==(other)
		value == other.value
	end

	def !=(other)
		value == other.value
	end
end

foo1 = Foo.new(1)
foo2 = Foo.new(2)

p foo1 == foo2  # false
p foo1 != foo2  # also false
p foo2 == foo2  # true
p foo2 != foo2  # also true
```

#### Comparison methods

Implementing the comparison methods gives us a really nice syntax for comparing objects.  Let's use the following class for example:

```ruby
class Person
	attr_accessor :name, :age

	def initialize(name, age)
		@name = name
		@age = age
	end
end
```

We can then instantiate a few objects

```ruby
bob = Person.new("Bob", 49)
kim = Person.new("Kim", 33)
```

What happens if we try to compare them?

```ruby
puts "bob is older than kim" if bob > kim
```

If we run this code, we get a ` NoMethodError `
- There is no defined ` > ` method for the class ` Person ` .
- This can be fixed by adding one to the class

```ruby
class Person
	# rest of code omitted for brevity

	def >(other_person)
		age > other_person.age
	end
end
```

This implementation will cause some problems.
- It will return ` true ` if the current object's age is greater than the ` other_person ` 's age and ` false ` otherwise. 
- Notice that we are pushing the comparison functionality to the ` Integer#> ` method
	- Now we can use the ` Person#> ` method in conditionals

```ruby
puts "bob is older" if bob > kim    # => "bob is older"
puts "bob is older" if bob.>(kim)   # => "bob is older"
```

Unlike the ` == ` method, defining the ` > ` method doesn't automatically give us a ` < ` method. 
- If we were to write ` bob < kim ` , we'd get a ` NoMethodError ` .

However, like the ` == ` and ` != ` methods, we need to be careful about defining  `< ` and ` > ` or both of the ` <= ` and ` >= ` methods. 
- Easy to write code that introduces very odd behaviors.

#### The ` << ` and ` >> ` shift methods

We've encountered the ` << ` method when working with arrays. It's pretty standard to use it in this way:

```ruby
array = %w(hello world)
array << "!!"
puts my_array.inspect      # => ['hello', 'world', '!!']
```

The ` << ` isn't a standard Ruby method. In this example, the method being called actually belongs to the ` Array ` class.
- This is why this method isn't available for hashes.
	- The ` Hash ` class doesn't contain this method

```ruby
my_hash = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}
my_hash << {d: 4}                           # => NoMethodError: undefined method `<<' for Hash
```

The ` NoMethodError ` gives us a clue that this is in fact a method and not an operator.

Just like any of the other fake operators, we can implement (define within our classes) ` << ` or ` >> ` to do anything. 
- It's not common to do so

When implementing fake operators, choose some functionality  that makes sense when used with special operator-like syntax. 
- For example, using the ` << ` method first well when working with a class that represents a collection.

```ruby
class Team
	attr_accessor :name, :members

	def initialize(name)
		@name = name
		@members = []
	end

	def <<(person)
		members.push person
	end
end

patriots = Team.new("New England Patriots") 
brady = Person.new("Tom Brady", 45) # suppose we're using the `Person` class from earlier

patriots << brady # will this work? guess: yes

patriots.members  # => [#<Person:0x007fe08c209530>]
```

By implementing a ` Team#<< ` method, we provided a very clean interface for adding new members to a team object.
- If we wanted to be strict, we could even build in a guard clause to reject adding the member unless some criteria is met.

```ruby
def <<(person)
	return if person.not_yet_18? # suppose we had a method that validates age
	member.push person
end
```

Adding the shift operators an result in very clean code, but they make the most sense when working with classes that represent a collection.

#### The plus method

` + ` looks like an operator, but it's actually a method. 

```ruby
1 + 1    # => 2
1.+(1)   # => 2
```

For this reason, Rubyists keep repeating the phrase *everything in Ruby is an object*, and that's true for integers as well.

Because integers are objects of the ` Integer ` class, they have access to the ` Integer ` instance methods. In the case of ` 1.+(1) ` , the method we're using is ` Integer#+ ` .

When should we write a ` + ` method for our own objects? The Ruby standard library may be able to provide some inspiration:

- ` Integer#+ `: increments the value by value of the argument, returning a new integer
- ` String# `: concatenates with the argument, returning a new string
- ` Array#+ `: concatenates with argument, returning a new array
- ` Date#+ `: increments the date in days by value of the argument, returning a new date

What's the pattern here?
- The functionality of the ` + ` should be either incrementing or concatenation with the argument.

Example: 

```ruby
class Team
	attr_acessor :name, :members

	def initialize(name)
		@name = name
		@members = []
	end

	def <<(person)
		members.push person
	end

	def +(other_team)
		members + other_team.members
	end
end

patriots = Team.new("New England Patriots")
patriots << Person.new("Tom Brady", 45)
patriots << Person.new("Randy Moss", 46)
patriots << Person.new("Wes Welker", 41)
patriots << Person.new("Tedy Bruschi", 49)

niners = Team.new("San Francisco 49ers")
niners << Person.new("Joe Montana", 49)
niners << Person.new("Jerry Rice", 42)
niners << Person.new("Deion Sanders", 47)
```

This is our set up code. We haven't used the ` Team#+ ` method yet. We have it defined. Based off the definition, how could we use it?
- Concatenating the ` members ` of each team.

```ruby
dream_team = patriots + niners
```

This will concatenate the arrays stored in the ` @members ` instance variable of both objects.
- It's an array of ` Person ` objects.

Does this match the general pattern we saw from the standard library?
- Not it doesn't.
	- The ` Integer#+ ` method returns a new ` Integer ` object; the ` String#+ ` method returns a new ` String ` object etc.

Our ` Team#+ ` method should return a new ` Team ` object. The ` Team#initialize ` method requires a name for an argument.
- For now, we can initialize the team name to "Temporary Team".

```ruby
class Team
	# rest of class omitted for brevity

	def +(other_team)
		temp_team = Team.new("Temporary Team")
		temp_team.members = members + other_team.members
		temp_team
	end
end
```

Assume we set up the ` patriots ` and ` niners ` teams again like before, we can now do this:

```ruby
dream_team = patriots + niners
puts dream_team.inspect
```

` dream_team ` is no longer an array, but a ` Team ` object, which is what we'd expect when we use ` Team#+ ` .

#### Element setter and getter methods

We've encountered element setter and getter methods previously.
- Have used them for strings, hashes and arrays.

The syntactical sugar is more extreme than the previous methods covered.

```ruby
array = %w(first second third fourth)

array[2]    # => third
array[].(2) # => third
```

The above two examples of using ` Array#[] ` to reference an element are somewhat identical, yet still look very different.
- The ` 2 ` gets placed in the square brackets because Ruby is giving us a nice syntax

Ruby goes a step further with ` Array#[]= `.

```ruby
# element assignment

array[4] = "fifth"
puts array.inspect # => ["first", "second", "third", "fourth", "fifth"]
```

The syntax ` array[4] = "fifth" ` reads more naturally.
- This syntax is also why it's sometimes hard to understand where certain code comes from.

So how can we define setter and getter methods for a class?
- First, need to make sure we're working with a class that represents a collection.
	- Need to follow the lead of the Ruby standard library, and build them as simple getter (reference) and setter (assignment) methods for elements in our collection.

```ruby
class Team
	# rest of code omitted for brevity

	def [](idx)
		members[idx]
	end

	def []=(idx, obj)
		members[idx] = obj
	end
end
```

With this, we're taking advantage of the fact that ` @members ` is an array.
- We can push the real work to the ` Array#[] ` and ` Array[]= ` methods.

After writing these two methods, we can use them like so:

```ruby
patriots.members   # => returns an array of 4 `Person` objects

p patriots[1] # => #<Person:0x00007f8799598d28 @name="Randy Moss", @age=46>
patriots[4] = Person.new("Julian Edelman", 36)
p patriots[4] # => #<Person:0x00007f87995987d8 @name="Julian Edelman", @age=36>
```

We can now use element reference and assignment with these methods on objects of the ` Team ` class. 
- The syntactical sugar also adds a new readability aspect to our code.


#### Summary

In this assignment, we saw how many operators are in fact methods that Ruby gives special treatment to. Because they are methods, we can implement them in our classes and take advantage of the special syntax for our own objects. If we do that, we must be careful to follow conventions established in the Ruby standard library. Otherwise, using those methods will be very confusing.

The most important thing for now is being able to read Ruby code. Learning how to write your own fake operators will take more time, but the goal right now is to alleviate confusion about why you see certain syntax, but can't understand what's happening. Hopefully this assignment shed some light on that.
