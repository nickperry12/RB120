# How does encapsulation relate to the public interface of a class?

=begin
Encapsulation involves creating containers for code, and makes that code
unavailable to the public interace. Ruby achieves this by defining classes and
instantiating objects of the class. Through the instantiated object we are able
to invoke the defined methods in the class. By doing this, methods cannot be
invoked and data cannot be manipulated without obvious intention. Encapsulation
defines boundaries with our code and the public interface, allowing us to
achieve higher levels of complexity, as well as reducing dependencies in our
code.
